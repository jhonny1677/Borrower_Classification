## Installation

To use the Borrower Classification code, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine by executing the following command:

    ```
    `git clone https://github.com/jhonny1677/Borrower_Classification.git`
    ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.x and pip installed on your system.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

    ```
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    ```

Once you have the repository and dependencies set up, you can use the modular code for borrower classification as follows:

1. Prepare your dataset for training and evaluation. The dataset should be split into features (X) and labels (y), where X represents the input features and y represents the target labels.

2. Use the provided modules and code files to perform tasks such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction. The modular structure allows you to customize and combine different components based on your requirements.

3. Start with the `data_preprocessing.py` module to preprocess your dataset, handle missing values, perform feature scaling, and encode categorical variables.

4. Use the `feature_engineering.py` module to create additional features or transform existing features to enhance the predictive power of your model.

5. Utilize the `model_training.py` module to train and optimize your classification model using various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines (SVM).

6. Evaluate the performance of your trained models using the `model_evaluation.py` module. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) to assess the model's effectiveness.

7. Finally, use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen borrower data using the `model_prediction.py` module.

Feel free to modify the provided code, add your own algorithms, or customize the workflow to suit your specific borrower classification needs.

## Data

The Borrower Classification code expects a prepared dataset in a suitable format. Make sure your dataset is split into features (X) and labels (y) and is appropriately preprocessed before using the code. You can replace the example dataset provided with your own data or update the code accordingly.

## Methods

The modular code for borrower classification includes various methods and techniques, such as:

- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- Feature engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing features to improve model performance.
- Model training: Utilizing algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines (SVM) for classification.
- Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or AUC-ROC.
- Model prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen borrower data.

Each module and code file provides detailed comments and explanations to guide you through the borrower classification process.
